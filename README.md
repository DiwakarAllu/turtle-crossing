## Embark on a Thrilling Turtle Crossing Adventure with Python!

Get ready for an exciting adventure with our Python-based Turtle Crossing Game! In this thrilling game, you'll navigate your way through a bustling street, filled with speeding vehicles and a single goal: safely reach the other side.

**How It Works: The Game Elements**

1. **player.py:** Meet your trusty turtle protagonist! Using clever functions, you'll guide your turtle forward when you issue the command.

2. **car_manager.py:** Beware of the traffic! Randomly generated rectangles on the right side of the screen represent vehicles. These vehicles move horizontally, making the journey quite challenging.

3. **scoreboard.py:** Your progress is tracked here. Each successful turtle crossing earns you a level up. As you advance, expect the vehicle traffic to get faster.

4. **main.py:** The heart of the game. This is where the action happens. Objects are created, controls are in your hands, and crucial functions are set into motion.

**The Challenge: Cross the Street Safely**

Your goal is simple yet demanding: guide your turtle across the busy street. Cross safely without colliding with any of the fast-moving vehicles. Each successful crossing elevates you to the next level, but be warnedâ€”the vehicles speed up as you progress.

**Game Over Warning**

A single collision with a vehicle will spell the end of your journey. So, keep your wits about you, time your moves, and help your turtle navigate this treacherous road!
